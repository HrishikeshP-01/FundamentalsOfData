# Data Nuts & Bolts : Fundamentals of Data
- *Data* – Raw & unstructured facts that convey a message
- *Information* – contextualized, organized & vetted data that conveys some sort of trend or pattern

Data -> Information is one of the most important tasks of IT. The end info answers questions such as who, where, when, what & how

- *Knowledge* – application of information. It’s measured by the ability to do things using the know how gained from Information.
- *Wisdom* - Ability to use knowledge & experience to make good decisions

## Sources of data generation & data formats
Common data collection types
- *Observational* – Obtained from direct observation. Eg: Temp. of a room
- *Experimental* - Obtained from research & investigation. Eg: DNA sequencing results
- *Compiled* – Acquired through manual data gathering, aggregated over time. Eg: Data mining
- *Simulated* – Results of studying certain behaviors & identifying new patterns. Eg:- Customer shopping behavior.

## Common data generation sources
- *Human generated data* – data from phones, emails, calls, web etc.
- *Machine generated data* – IoT, medical equipment, satellites etc.
- *Business generated data* – Banks, stock exchanges, etc.

## Data formats w.r.t storage & processing
- *Structured* – easiest to search & analyze, often stored in rows & cols
- *Unstructured* – not contained in row-col database
- *Semi-structured* – has some defining & consistent characteristics. It doesn’t conform to a structure as rigid as expected with a database. There are some organizational properties called semantic tags or metadata to make it easier to organize but there’s still fluidity in the data. Eg: XML, JSON

You can’t perform analytics on unstructured data. It has to be transformed to structed data.
